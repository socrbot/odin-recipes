    <h2>Easy Lasagna Recipe</h2>
        <p>This recipe has simple ingredients but tons of flavor with a <strong>creamy ricotta mixture, savory meat sauce, and lots of mozzarella cheese.&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>This is a great freezer meal, make-ahead recipe, and leftovers freeze and reheat&nbsp;<em>super well.&nbsp;</em></p>
    <h2>How to Make It</h2>
        <p><strong>Spoon meat sauce on the bottom of a lightly greased casserole dish. Add 4 boiled lasagna noodles (or use no-boil or fresh noodles). Spread 1/3 of the ricotta cheese mixture on top. Add 1.5 cups of meat sauce.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Repeat the same layers two more times.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Top with mozzarella cheese. Cover and bake at 375Â° for 30 minutes. Remove cover and bake for 15 more minutes. Broil at the end if desired. Let it rest for 15 minutes prior to serving</p>
        <h2>How Many Layers Does Lasagna Have</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Lasagna needs to have <strong>at least</strong> <strong>3 layers</strong> in order to constitute a true lasagna. <strong>Most recipes have 3 or 4 layers.</strong></li>
            <li>I opted for <strong>3 layers of 4 lasagna noodles</strong> as that is what will fit in a 9 x 13 inch casserole dish. Additional layers would require a deeper baking dish</a>.&nbsp;</li>
        </ul>
